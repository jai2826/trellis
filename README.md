## Customization

You can customize your widget from settings on the dashboard.

## Testing

To Test the widget bot go to : 

https://trellis-widget.vercel.app/?organizationId=org_350P1wrI0kNxDhjYbIP6w9s8JEe

This is a test organization with enabled vapi and pro plan

You can use your own organization id. But you need to enable Vapi and also use the development card for billings and switch to pro plan.

When you go the above widget link it will ask you for name and email. 
This name and email are not used as login info rather than to keep track of session.

If the pro plan is enabled you will be able to use calling features.

You can use the integrations setup from the dashboard to directly use the bot in you react/next/javascript app.
